Welcome to **Bankist**, your go-to minimal banking experience! Our sleek and interactive UI is designed to make your financial journey as smooth as possible. Dive into the features that will make you fall in love with banking all over again.

## Features at a Glance

### Modal Magic
Ever felt the need for a pop-up to remind you how awesome you are? Our modals do just that! With a simple click, you can open a modal window that will overlay your screen, bringing focus to the most important tasks at hand.

### Smooth Scrolling
Say goodbye to janky scrolling! Our smooth scroll functionality ensures you glide through sections like a hot knife through butter. Click on the button and enjoy the ride down to Section 1 without any hiccups.

### Tabbed Navigation
Tabs? We've got you covered. Our operations tab system lets you switch between different financial services with ease. Click on a tab, and watch the magic unfold as the content changes without reloading the page.

### Sticky Navigation
Our sticky navigation bar sticks with you through thick and thin (and scrolling). It only appears when you need it, and disappears when you don’t. It’s like having a loyal friend who knows when to give you space.

### Lazy Loading Images
No one likes to wait, especially for images to load. With our lazy loading feature, images only load when you need them, saving bandwidth and speeding up your browsing experience. It’s like having a butler who only serves you exactly when you’re ready.

### Slider to Success
Our image slider keeps your eyes entertained with beautiful transitions. Whether you're clicking through with the arrows or using the dots below, you'll never get bored. It's the fun part of your banking day!

### Fading Navigation Menu
Hover over our navigation links and watch as other elements gracefully fade out, allowing you to focus on what’s important. It’s like a spotlight on stage, but for your financial needs.

### Intersection Observer API Magic
Sections reveal themselves like a curtain lifting on a stage as you scroll. With our Intersection Observer API, each section comes into view exactly when it should. Because timing is everything, especially in banking.

### JavaScript Awesomeness
Behind the scenes, JavaScript is doing all the heavy lifting. From event listeners to scroll effects, our code is optimized to provide you with the best experience possible. It's the unsung hero of our website!
